                        <h3>🌱 Why We Started</h3>
                        <p>NeuroNur was born out of a deep passion for neuroscience and a belief in the power of collaboration. Many aspiring researchers—especially in regions with limited resources—face barriers to participating in impactful research. We wanted to change that.</p>
                        <p>Our goal is to create an inclusive and supportive platform where individuals from all backgrounds can contribute meaningfully to neuroscience. Whether you're a student, early-career scientist, or seasoned researcher, NeuroNur is a space to learn, grow, and make a difference—together.</p>
